# BaseCompose v0.1: Launch Day

Today marks a significant milestone in the BaseCompose journey. We're excited to announce the official release of **BaseCompose v0.1** — a powerful platform that eliminates the friction of environment setup for modern applications.

## The Problem We're Solving

Every developer knows the pain: setting up a new project environment is tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming. You need to configure databases, set up authentication, integrate logging, and manage countless dependencies. By the time you're done, hours have passed, and you haven't written a single line of business logic.

BaseCompose changes this paradigm entirely.

## What's New in v0.1

### 🚀 Instant Environment Scaffolding

Generate production-ready environments in minutes, not hours. Choose your tech stack, and we handle the rest:

- **Frontend Frameworks**: Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte
- **Backend**: Node.js, FastAPI, Django, Go
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Authentication**: NextAuth, Auth0, Custom implementations
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes configurations included

### 📦 Layered Architecture Blueprint

Our innovative blueprint system allows you to:

- Start with a foundation and layer features
- Mix and match components based on your needs
- Scale from MVP to enterprise seamlessly

### 🔗 Chat-First Interface

Generate your entire stack through an intuitive conversation interface. Ask questions like "Create a Next.js app with MongoDB, JWT auth, and Redis caching" and it's done.

### 🎯 Pre-configured Best Practices

Every generated project includes:

- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
- Docker and docker-compose setups
- Environment variable templates
- Security hardening out of the box

## Feature Highlights
